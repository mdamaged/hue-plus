# hue-plus
A Linux driver in Python for the NZXT Hue+
## Install
To install it system wide, simply run install.sh as root `sudo ./install.sh`
Now it will be available as `hue` and `hue-picker`
**To use the GUI you must have zenity installed**

No Audio, FPS, CPU temp, GPU temp or Custom, but other than that a perfect replica.

## Warning
  I (the author) hold no liability for any broken or not working Hue+ by running this script. It is provided as is. It worked for me, but your milage may vary
